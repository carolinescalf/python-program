Explanation of COC and License

We chose the license and COC that we did because we found them easy to read and understand. For the license, we found that a link to the full document, along with a brief description of what said license allows, was simple for a potential user to understand. We chose the COC because its wording about inclusive language and conduct was important to us. As developers, it is imperative that we create a safe environment for whoever uses our programs.
