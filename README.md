# python-program

This program prompts the user for their name and their birth year (between 1990 and 2015), and then outputs their Chinese zodiac sign based on their answer. It also outputs a description of qualities based on your sign, as well as lucky numbers.

The program can be installed via GitHub: carolinescalf/python-program. Clicking the green 'Code' button will allow you to copy the repository into Jupyterhub for your own personal use. 

The main code file is 'python-project.ipynb'.
